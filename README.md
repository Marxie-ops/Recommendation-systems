# Travel Recommendation-systems
## ***Problem Addressed***
Travelers often face challenges such as:

* Information Overload: The vast amount of travel-related information available online can be overwhelming, making it difficult to find relevant and personalized options.

* Lack of Personalization: Traditional travel platforms may offer generic suggestions that do not cater to individual preferences, leading to suboptimal travel experiences.

* Time-Consuming Planning: Manually researching and organizing travel plans, including flights, accommodations, and activities, can be time-intensive and complex.

***Project Overview***
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook titled Building_a_Hybrid_Recommendation_systems_For_Travel_Agencies.ipynb, indicating the implementation of a hybrid recommendation system. 
### ***Recommendation Approach***
We implement a hybrid model using:

Collaborative Filtering:

Alternating Least Squares (ALS) – A matrix factorization technique that captures latent patterns from user-item interactions.

Content-Based Filtering:

TF-IDF Vectorization – Converts textual travel metadata (e.g., destination descriptions) into weighted word features.

Cosine Similarity – Measures similarity between items to suggest travel options similar to what a user already liked. to improve accuracy and personalization.

***Potential Solution Approach***
Hybrid recommendation systems often integrate:

* Collaborative Filtering: Leveraging user behavior and preferences to suggest destinations or services that similar users have enjoyed.

* Content-Based Filtering: Analyzing item attributes (e.g., destination features, hotel amenities) to recommend options similar to those a user has liked in the past.

* Demographic Filtering: Considering user demographics (e.g., age, location) to tailor recommendations.

***Future Expansion***
The project will be integrated with Agentic AI tools to create a more interactive and autonomous system capable of handling complex user travel needs.

Planning to integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT to handle natural language queries from travelers, enabling the system to act as a conversational assistant for trip planning, customer support, and itinerary personalization.
